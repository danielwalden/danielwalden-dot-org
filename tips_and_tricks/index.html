<h1>Daniel Walden's Tips and Tricks Collection</h1>
<p>Currently rough. Will be better organized later. Also add an anchor list for better navigation.</p>

<h2>Social Media</h2>

<h3>Facebook</h3>

<h3>Instagram</h3>
<p>2200 character = max Instagram caption length.</p>
<p>140 characters before “more”</p>
<p>1080x1350 is the maximum picture resolution. 566 minimum.</p>
<p>4:5 ratios<br>
	1080x1350<br>
	864x1080<br>
	600x750<br>
	640x800 seems to be the displayed size for video<br>
</p>
<p>Max file size before compression… Somewhere above 227.3KB?</p>

<h3>Tumblr</h3>
<p>Raw image base url (Also replace “…1280.jpg” with “…raw.jpg”)<br>
	https://s3.amazonaws.com/data.tumblr.com/
</p>

<h2>Web Design</h2>

<p>Use 9to5mac one-page idea, except maybe in two columns. Make the cards zig-zag? Make a cool animation for when they expand. Flex box and fixed-height elements would be good for the zig zag columns.</p>
<p>iPhone X landscape safe area = 724pts<br>
	iPhone X total landscape area = 812pts<br>
	(44pt gutters)<br>
	iPad 12 split area = ~680<br>
	iPad 12 landscape = 1366pts<br>
	Max mobile width = 677px<br>
	iPhone Plus = 736pts<br>
</p>
<p>Mobile, 720pt, 1024/1020pt(~1.5x)<br>
	Design at 720<br>
	Mobile at 360<br>
</p>

<h2>Photoshop</h2>

<h3>How to add SS glow in PS</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Blur a copy layer, set it to Screen</li>
	<li>Clip a level adjustment, increase black level and fiddle as needed</li>
	<li>Desaturate blur layer if you want to keep the same color, or use LAB adjustments</li>
</ol>
<p>Wide support for Gif frame-rate maxes out at ~0.06ms. Animate at 17fps then.</p>
<p>For getting noise out of out-of-focus areas, use Median before Blur. It will de-noise without destroying contours.</p>
<p>To show off P3 color gamut without over-saturating, only increase saturation in dark and bright areas. LAB, curves, and blend options should do this nicely.</p>
<p>You don’t need to mess with DPI to match web font sizes, just type in px. (2x/3x if you’re doing retina)</p>

<h2>MacOS</h2>

<p>“Stationary” in Get Info</p>

<h3>Calls to Action</h3>
<p>"Contact Us Today!"</p>
<p>"See Our Products and Services!"</p>

<h2>Music</h2>

<p>33bpm is supposedly the slowest possible tempo for humans. (get source)</p>
<p>The Cicada Principle can be applied to music, to make long dynamic pieces. (Source: Portal 2 Laser Music)</p>

<h3>Job Interviews</h3>
<p>What to Ask Interviewers (borrowed from YOSPOS, don't remember who):</p>

<p>- who do you work with on a daily basis / describe the day to day role</p>
<p>translation : are you working with a well-defined team that puts out consistent work or is this place a clusterfuck with people coming and going on a weekly basis because management is incompetent</p>

<p>- how are decisions made / how will [team] be asked to accomplish things / who makes those decisions</p>
<p>translation: are the people making decisions that impact your work accountable to you / your team and do you have the ability to influence them or are they dictated from on high or even worse forced upon you by a hostile entity</p>

<p>- what are the company's primary values? what characteristics are you looking for in a candidate in relation to those primary values?</p>
<p>translation: if they say 'uhhhhhhhhhh' here it's a red flag. if they throw gibberish at you it's not a red flag but it's not a good look either. this should get a human bean answer</p>

<p>- what would be expected of me for the first / three / six months? What will success look like in this position, how will it be measured?</p>
<p>translation: same as the last one. </p>

<p>- what sort of training/mentoring/career dev things are here</p>
<p>translation: they should also be able to answer this without thinking. if they hesitate or bullshit you it's a red flag</p>

<p>- what's the most impressive thing you've seen out of someone else you've interviewed recently</p>
<p>translation: what qualities are people here impressed with. what caliber of candidates are you also considering.</p>

<p>- What do you see as the most challenging aspect of this job?</p>
<p>translation: every job has some bullshit aspect to it. this is their chance to lay it on softly and your chance to decide if it's a particular brand of bullshit you can put up with</p>

<p>- how do you set milestones/deliverables for projects and how does your team react when it's clear they won't be met</p>
<p>translation: are you going to work me like a slave when we don't hit the deadline we never agreed to </p>

<p>- when was the last time you took pto / how much did you take / what did you do</p>
<p>translation: without fail shitty interviewers for shitty companies will try to deflect this one. if they try to say 'oh no don't worry about that' or respond with their actual pto policy just reiterate that they didn't answer your question. when was the last time YOU took pto</p>
